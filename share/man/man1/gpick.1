Pick a color. You can insert the color at point by pressing \fBCTRL-C\fR. To hide the floating instance, press \fBESC\fR.

When this option is used, gpick is run in the background, so that all other floating instances don't start a new process. If cloosing the process is needed, then see the \fB-s\fR flag.
